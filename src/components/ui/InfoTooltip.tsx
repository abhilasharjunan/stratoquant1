  volatility: "How much the fund's returns swing up and down over a year (annualized). Lower means steadier, more predictable returns.",
  maxDrawdown: "The largest drop from a peak to a low point historically. Shows the worst-case loss an investor would have experienced.",
  beta: "Sensitivity to the broader market. 1.0 moves with the market; above 1 is more volatile than the market, below 1 is less.",
  alpha: "Excess return versus what beta alone would predict — a rough measure of the fund's skill beyond just tracking the market.",
  rSquared: "How much of the fund's movement is explained by the benchmark (0-100%). Higher means it behaves more like an index fund.",
  treynorRatio: "Return earned per unit of market risk (beta), rather than total risk. Useful for comparing well-diversified funds.",
  hhi: "Herfindahl-Hirschman Index — a concentration measure. Closer to 0 means spread across many holdings/categories; closer to 1 means concentrated in few.",
  concentrationRisk: "How concentrated the fund's top disclosed holdings are (HHI). Higher means the fund's returns depend heavily on a few stocks.",
  sectorConcentration: "The combined weight of the fund's top 3 sectors among its disclosed holdings. Higher means less sector diversification.",
  overlapPercentage: "Weighted overlap between two funds' top disclosed holdings — the share of stocks (by allocation) they both hold.",
  compositeScore: "A single 0-100 blend of volatility, drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino, alpha, beta, and R-squared. Lower generally means lower risk.",
  diversificationScore: "0-100 score based on how evenly your holdings are spread across fund categories (via HHI). Higher means better diversified.",
